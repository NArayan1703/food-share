        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to FoodShare! We are a community-driven organization dedicated to reducing food waste and helping those in need. Our mission is to connect surplus food providers with food recipients through our innovative web app.</p>
        <p>Since our inception, we have partnered with various food businesses, restaurants, and individuals who generously donate their surplus food items to our platform. Our dedicated team ensures that these surplus food items are efficiently distributed to those who need them the most.</p>
        <p>At FoodShare, we believe in the power of collective action to make a positive impact on society. Together, we can create a world where surplus food finds its way to those who are hungry, reducing food waste and hunger simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Join us in our journey to make a difference in the lives of millions. Together, we can create a sustainable and compassionate community where no one goes hungry.</p>
